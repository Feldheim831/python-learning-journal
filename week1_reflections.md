**Week 1 Reflections**

  So far, I have learned a little background on computers, and computer programming. I learned about computer hardware, such as central processing units, random access memory, and solid state drives. I have also learned about the difference between high level languages, learned about machine code, and how computers read binary code. 

  With python, I learned about how the languages deal with different types of variables, including floats, integers, strings, and boolean variables. I learned about when/where to use the different variable types, and standard syntax for how to name them. I learned a few functions such as print(), input(), and open(). With this knowledge, I was able to create programs such as a Mad Libs game, a unit converter, and a program that can enter user data into a text file.
