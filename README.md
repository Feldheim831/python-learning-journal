A repository to document my Python learning journey

**About me**

I am a chemistry student transferring to UC Berkeley in Fall, 2025. I am interested in learning python because of its wide use for data analysis in the physical sciences. 

**Goals for this course**

My goal for this course is to gain a basic understanding on programming techniques, the python syntax, and how to _think_ like a programmer. Hopefully by the end of this course, I will be able to create basic python programs, and get comfortable with looking up how to do things with python that I currently do not know about. I am not sure if I will take another formal python class after this one, but I do intend to continue learning online after I complete this course. Coding appears to be an extremely powerful tool that I would like to use to make my life easier, even outside school/carreer. 

**My First Program**

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
